# LDA_and_KNN #
This repository includes five python files:

* **Generate_Gaussian_Dataset:** code to generate a dataset of Gaussians according to the requirements provided in Question.pdf

* **Probabilistic_LDA:** code to run the Probabilistic LDA model from scratch on the dataset generated, reporting key performance metrics.

* **KNN:** code to run the KNN model from scratch on the dataset generated, reporting key performance metrics.

* **Generate_Gaussian_Mixture_Dataset:** code to generate a dataset of Gaussian Mixtures according to the requirements provided in Question.pdf

* **LDA_and_KNN:** code to run a linear LDA model and a non-linear KNN model on the newly generated dataset, reporting key performance metrics.

See the Question.pdf for more details, and the Report.pdf for a detailed analysis of the overall conclusions drawn.
